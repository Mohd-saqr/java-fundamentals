in the Stretch Goals **Some Restaurants are part of a chain, and it would be nice to capture, for example, that all the McDonaldâ€™s locations are McDonaldses.
Choose an implementation for this, and implement it.
Add tests for this functionality.** i must create interface ? or create class for Restaurants ? or what ?
